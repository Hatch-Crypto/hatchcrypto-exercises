# Deposit - Allocate and Withdraw Funds

In the previous exercise (*Payable - Work With Value*), you have learned about possible usage of `payable` modifier. You will put this knowledge into practice in this exercise.

## Inheritance

Solidity supports multiple inheritance using C3 linearization (like in Python). In this exercise, we will inherit from only one contract which we created previously.

```
contract Deposit is Ownable {
  ...
}
```
